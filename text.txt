you want an algorithm that takes up less memory slots

if you declare a variable and assign value to it, that value is what stored in the memory slot.
so that specific memory slot is not free anymore.

back to back memory slots.
you need back to back contigous memory slots.

a value let's say 1 gets converted into its binary form / bits form. base 2 system

1 memory slot can hold 8 bits. 8 bits is called byte
so when you store data in a memory slot you actually store a byte.

fixed width integer: it will always take up the number of bits divide by 8 in the memory slot.

cells or slots number are referenced as memory addresses and they are also binary based digits.
you can store other memory address to another slot as a pointer to that original memory slot.

hash tables
a   table is a key value store. a datastructure where you are able to store key and value pairs.
insertion, deletion and searching are all constant time operation 0(1)
